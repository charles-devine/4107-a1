    <HEAD>Opposition Leader Faces Court Appearance</HEAD>
    <TEXT>
        PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Opposition leader Louis Dejoie was
        summoned to court next week for a hearing apparently related to his
        arrest on charges of inciting the public to revolt, a Dejoie aide
        said Friday.
        Aide Philippe Stevenson said Dejoie's lawyer had mistakenly
        informed him that the hearing was Friday.
        Stevenson said that Dejoie went to the Palace of Justice Friday
        morning, but was informed by court officials that his hearing was
        not until Thursday.
        ``I think it will be just to close his case since he was
        officially in provisional liberty,'' Stevenson said.
        Neither Dejoie's lawyer, Georges Leger, nor Dejoie could be
        reached at their homes for comment.
        Dejoie was arrested Jan. 20 when he returned from a monthlong
        trip to the United States, Canada and the West Indies. During the
        trip he called for an economic boycott of Haiti to protest the
        aborted Nov. 29 election and government-run elections Jan. 17.
        Dejoie was charged with inciting the public to riot and held for
        two days before his release.
        The Nov. 27 elections, which were run by an independent
        Electoral Council, were canceled after thugs killed 34 people and
        wounded 76. Witnesses said the army did not stop the violence and
        in some cases participated in it.
        President Leslie Manigat won a Jan. 17 election that was
        boycotted by the major candidates from the Nov. 27 balloting.
        Turnout was low and there was no secret ballot.

    <HEAD>Prisoners Subdued After Attacking Guards, Officials Say</HEAD>

        Six Cuban prisoners became unruly during a
        cell transfer Friday, and three officers and an inmate suffered
        minor injuries in the fracas, authorities said.
        The six began ``ranting and raving and throwing things,'' said
        Sheriff Aubrey Cole. He said the inmates were not trying to escape.
        The prisoners, who are being housed by the county for the
        Immigration and Naturalization Service, were being taken to
        separate cells when they jumped some jailers and officers, Cole
        said.
        ``When they opened the cell and moved them out into the hallway
        they began to fight the officers,'' Cole said.
        Dispatcher David Weaver, Deputy Jack Myers, and jailer Eddie
        Johnson suffered minor injuries, Cole said. An inmate also was
        bruised. No medical treatment was needed, Cole said.
        All six prisoners will be charged with assault on peace officers
        and will be returned to the custody of the INS, Cole said.
        Cole said the sheriff's department called the Jasper Police
        Department for help.
        A subsequent search of the prisoners' cell uncovered two
        homemade weapons that had been fashioned from metal electrical
        switch plates taken from the walls, sharpened and wrapped at one
        end with cloth, Cole said.
        Five Cuban nationals escaped from the jail in October. All five
        were later apprehended.

    <HEAD>Moscow Director Misses Homeland But Welcomes Gorbachev Changes</HEAD>

        Stage director Yuri Lyubimov, who has been called
        the Soviet Union's greatest theatrical figure, says he misses his
        homeland but welcomes the changes going on there since he was
        exiled four years ago.
        ``I miss my theater, my friends and my relatives, but if I want
        snow I can always go to Canada or Chicago or call on Solzhenitsyn
        in Vermont,'' he said in an interview at the Royal Opera House,
        Covent Garden.
        ``I also miss the unique Soviet audiences who hunger for
        something spiritual,'' said Lyubimov, among the world's outstanding
        directors.
        Lyubimov, a youthful 70, this year became a citizen of Israel.
        He lives in Jerusalem with his Hungarian wife, Katalin, and son,
        Peter. Another son, Nikita, is in Moscow.
        Lyubimov talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday night at
        the stage door after an applauded revival of his production of
        ``Jenufa'' by Czech composer Leos Janacek.
        ``Jenufa'' was first produced in 1904 and is a dark tale of
        peasant life, murder and penance.
        Lyuibmov ran Moscow's defiant Taganka Theater and was on a
        London visit to direct a play in March 1984 when he became came
        under criticism from then-leader Konstantin Chernenko.
        ``I was told I wouldn't be allowed to return home _ Chernenko
        was half alive at the time and dead 12 months later,'' the director
        recalled, speaking through an interpreter.
        Lyubimov said he's hopeful that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
        Gorbachev's policies of greater openness on selected subjects will
        last.
        ``A lot of things once forbidden are now being seen in the
        Soviet Union _ films, plays and books,'' he said. ``It would be a
        terrible tragedy if all this will be reversed, like it was once
        before when (Nikita) Khrushchev was deposed.
        ``But people coming from Russia tell me they really believe the
        change is irreversible and I hope all people of good will in the
        West will help,'' he said.
        The director said his name, in oblivion after his exile, has
        been restored by public demand to the Taganka Theater's programs
        for revivals of his celebrated productions.
        Lyubimov said the Soviet and Israeli political climates are
        ``very different and I'm trying to reconcile them.''
        The Royal Opera disclosed it has Lyubimov working on a new
        production of Richard Wagner's demanding four-opera ``Ring'' cycle
        for opening in September.
        Wagner, a German composer of genius, is anathema to many Jews
        who regard him as an anti-Semite. Wagner's music has been shouted
        down at concerts in Israel.
        ``Wagner is also little performed in the Soviet Union,''
        Lyubimov said. ``I once wanted to to use the march from (Wagner's)
        `Twilight of the Gods' in a festival music program, but it was
        forbidden.''
        The ``Ring'' is performed in a variety of costumes these days,
        from Viking style to modern evening dress. Lyubimov, when asked if
        his version will be traditional or modern, replied: ``I'm keeping
        that a secret, but I will try to use different kinds of symbolism
        and psychological concepts to bring Wagner closer to the people.''
        He said he was glad to be working on it with Bernard Haitink,
        the Royal Opera's recently appointed music director from Holland.
        ``Wagner's world is difficult to penetrate as he sought unity of
        all the forms, music and drama, and wrote a lot about it. The hard
        part about producing Wagner is that what you see on the stage must
        not destroy what you hear,'' the director said.
